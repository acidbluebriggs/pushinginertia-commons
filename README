This is a set of libraries with common reusable Java components. It is structured
in a way similar to Apache Commons but contains functionality that does not exist
in Apache Commons.


COMPONENTS
==========

This collection consists of the following components:

pushinginertia-commons-io: Common I/O related logic.
pushinginertia-commons-lang: Extensions to the java.lang package.
pushinginertia-commons-net: Network and protocol logic.
pushinginertia-commons-ui: Support for generating UI strings and internationalization.
pushinginertia-commons-web: Logic to assist with web-related development.


INSTALLATION
============

At present, you'll need to pull the source and build the JARs on your own. I have
future plans to make these components available through a maven repository but
that's not available yet. A proper versioning scheme will follow at this point
too.

You can build the JARs and install them into your local maven repository by
running:

    mvn install

Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.pushinginertia</groupId>
        <artifactId>pushinginertia-commons-XXX</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

where XXX is the specific component to include.
